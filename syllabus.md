# Overview

This is both an applied statistics and a technical communications course, and is intended for second year students in the Applied Statistics and Data Science master's programs. Students taking this course should already have completed master's level courses in probability, theoretical statistics, regression analysis, and multivariate statistics.

The goals of the course are as follows:

- Provide experience conducting data analyses through case studies drawn from multiple domains.
- Provide multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings and receive feedback.
- Provide exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical concepts.
- Provide hands-on experience working with data and implementing analyses.


# Grading


|   Component   |     Weight     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  Reports      | 70% (10% each) |
|  Peer Review  |      10%       |
|  Presentation |      20%       |

Each report will be graded by the GSI and two anonymous peer reviewers (see below). The overall grade for each report is calculated as:

50% times GSI score + 25% times Peer review 1 score + 25% times peer review 2 score

(In cases where one or both of the peer reviews is obviously unfair, the GSI is empowered to reweight the scores as they see fit to ensure fairness.)

## Reports
The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing assignments. There will be seven writing assignments, each based on a particular case study presented in lecture. Each writing assignment will be 2-3 pages in length and will resemble a memo prepared by a professional data analyst, summarizing methods and findings from an analysis.

Each writing assignment will address a writing prompt provided by the instructor. You will have significant latitude in your approach, but the analyses are not completely open-ended -- you should focus on addressing the issues raised in the writing prompt and in most cases you will be asked to use a specific analytic approach in your analysis.

Writing for this course is relatively short and focused. There is a hard limit 1000 words per report, which is about 2.5 typewritten pages. You will generally be expected to include one graph or table in each report. You should only include visual aids directly contribute to your main claims.

## Late submission policy
Late submissions are not accepted for any reason. If you feel you should be excused from turning in an assignment due to a medical or family emergency, notify the instructor by submitting a [report of illness and absence](https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/SAA/UGStuAdv/App/Illness/RptIll.aspx). 

## Peer review
After each report deadline, you will be assigned two other assignments to read, score, and comment on. The GSI will use your scores, along with their own judgement, to determine the final grade.

Peer review is doubly blind, meaning you will not know the identity of the author, and they will not know yours. Therefore, **you must use the peer reviews to give polite, honest, useful feedback**. Peer reviews that show an obvious lack of effort will be considered incomplete.

Peer reviews must be completed witinh three days after the assignment is submitted. Failure to complete the reviews by the deadline will result in your grade for that assignment being reduced by `25% * <number of incomplete reviews>`. 

## Presentation
Twenty percent of your grade is on your final presentation.  The final presentation will occur towards the end of the semester.   You will pick a case studies out of the eight assignments from the class for your final presentation. The final presentation should be comprehensive and clearly state the problem of interest, explain the data, analysis, and the final results clearly. 

# Academic Honesty

You are expected to abide by academic honesty standards set forth by the department and the graduate school. In particular, there is a **zero-tolerance** policy towards plagiarism of any form. Writing assignments will be checked against each other, as well as against a large database of submissions from past semesters, for plagiarism. Essays which are found to be plagiarized will receive a score of zero. Repeat offences will result in a failing grade and dismissal from the course.

## ChatGPT policy
It is okay to use ChatGPT/GenAI to improve your writing. It is _not_ okay to use ChatGPT to write  entire assignments for you. Keep in mind that part of your grade for each report is based on originality. It will be up to peer reviewers, GSI, and instructor to assess this based on how much of your submission was generated using AI (or copied from other online sources). 


## Expectations for student writing 

This is both an applied statistics course and a technical communications course. The coursework will consist of writing and data analysis. Only the writing will be graded (you will not submit any code for evaluation). All statisticians must frequently communicate and document their findings in written form. Writing about your analytic plans and research findings, and writing reviews and critiques of other people’s writing are all excellent ways to organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments, and identify weaknesses in your claims.

For most of the writing assignments in this course, you should imagine that you are writing a memo or email to be read by collaborators or colleagues. Your “audience” consists of people familiar with the data and scientific (or industrial) context behind the data, and who are also knowledgeable about statistics.

Below are some guidelines for writing in this course. These are a few of the most important things to keep in mind. We will expand on this a lot during the semester.

Write in an appropriate academic or business tone. Do not write informally or casually, but also avoid excessively formal language.

Organize your content so that your writing has a focused message, with each paragraph contributing distinctly to communicating this message.

Use simple, direct language. Avoid convoluted expressions, hidden or needlessly subtle meanings, unusual vocabulary, and digressions that do not contribute to your main message.

Express your arguments in as plain and simple terms as is practical. Do not write in a way that requires the reader to re-read your writing multiple times to understand your point. Favor short sentences in the active voice with one clause, and paragraphs that focus on one topic and do not extend for more than half a page.

Write for an audience that may include non-native English speakers. Avoid colloquialisms and obscure cultural references.

You are expected to be able to write in grammatically-correct English, appropriate for graduate level coursework. It is understood that there are many non-native English speakers in the course, and occasional minor grammatical issues will be overlooked.
