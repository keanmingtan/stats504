# Overview

This is both an applied statistics and a technical communications course, and is intended for second year students in the Applied Statistics and Data Science master's programs. Students taking this course should already have completed master's level courses in probability, theoretical statistics, regression analysis, and multivariate statistics.

The goals of the course are as follows:

- Provide experience conducting data analyses through case studies drawn from multiple domains.
- Provide multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings and receive feedback.
- Provide exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical concepts.
- Provide hands-on experience working with data and implementing analyses.


# Grading


|   Component   |     Weight     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  Reports      | 70% (10% each) |
|  Peer Review  |      10%       |
|  Presentation |      20%       |

Each report will be graded by the GSI and two anonymous peer reviewers (see below). The overall grade for each report is calculated as:

50% times GSI score + 25% times Peer review 1 score + 25% times peer review 2 score

(In cases where one or both of the peer reviews is obviously unfair, the GSI is empowered to reweight the scores as they see fit to ensure fairness.)

## Reports
The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing assignments. There will be seven writing assignments, each based on a particular case study presented in lecture. Each writing assignment will be 2-3 pages in length and will resemble a memo prepared by a professional data analyst, summarizing methods and findings from an analysis.

Each writing assignment will address a writing prompt provided by the instructor. You will have significant latitude in your approach, but the analyses are not completely open-ended -- you should focus on addressing the issues raised in the writing prompt and in most cases you will be asked to use a specific analytic approach in your analysis.

Writing for this course is relatively short and focused. There is a hard limit 1000 words per report, which is about 2.5 typewritten pages. You will generally be expected to include one graph or table in each report. You should only include visual aids directly contribute to your main claims.

## Late submission policy
Late submissions are not accepted for any reason. If you feel you should be excused from turning in an assignment due to a medical or family emergency, notify the instructor by submitting a [report of illness and absence](https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/SAA/UGStuAdv/App/Illness/RptIll.aspx). 

## Peer review
After each report deadline, you will be assigned two other assignments to read, score, and comment on. The GSI will use your scores, along with their own judgement, to determine the final grade.

Peer review is doubly blind, meaning you will not know the identity of the author, and they will not know yours. Therefore, **you must use the peer reviews to give polite, honest, useful feedback**. Peer reviews that show an obvious lack of effort will be considered incomplete.

Peer reviews must be completed witinh three days after the assignment is submitted. Failure to complete the reviews by the deadline will result in your grade for that assignment being reduced by `25% * <number of incomplete reviews>`. 

## Presentation
Twenty percent of your grade is on your final presentation.  The final presentation will occur towards the end of the semester.   You will pick a case studies out of the eight assignments from the class for your final presentation. The final presentation should be comprehensive and clearly state the problem of interest, explain the data, analysis, and the final results clearly. 

# Academic Honesty

You are expected to abide by academic honesty standards set forth by the department and the graduate school. In particular, there is a **zero-tolerance** policy towards plagiarism of any form. Writing assignments will be checked against each other, as well as against a large database of submissions from past semesters, for plagiarism. Essays which are found to be plagiarized will receive a score of zero. Repeat offences will result in a failing grade and dismissal from the course.

## ChatGPT policy
It is okay to use ChatGPT/GenAI to improve your writing. It is _not_ okay to use ChatGPT to write  entire assignments for you. Keep in mind that part of your grade for each report is based on originality. It will be up to peer reviewers, GSI, and instructor to assess this based on how much of your submission was generated using AI (or copied from other online sources).
