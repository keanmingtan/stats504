# iNaturalist research grade observations

[iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org) is a collection of *species
occurrence data*; it consists of observations of living
organisms made at specific locations at particular
moments in time. It is a form of "citizen science" that allows anybody
to contribute data.  There is a certain amount of vetting of the data
for quality, but like many large-scale datasets there are bound to be
some errors in the data.

Many interesting questions can be addressed using this type of data.
One point of particular interest is to assess whether the ranges of
specific species are moving in space over time.  This could be due to
changes in climate, or for other reasons.

It is important to note that the data are not collected
systematically, so that the observations are likely biased toward
locations where people live or visit, toward species that are easier
to identify or are more interesting to people, and to seasons when outdoor
activities are more common.

The complete iNaturalist dataset can be obtained
[here](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7)
but this is a very large dataset.  We provide
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/jo5ika5l84kr2wtw708vx/h?rlkey=8iy0w0mggomucx3hlcfmht88s&dl=0)
some selected subsets of data, for
example all occurrences in class *Pinopsida* (evergreen trees) and in class
Polypodiopsida (ferns).
